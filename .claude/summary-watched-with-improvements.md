# Watched With UX Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Add Movie Page (`src/app/add/page.tsx`)
**Problem:** No visual feedback when typing a custom buddy name.

**Solution:**
- Added green "Custom ✓" indicator when typing a custom name (not in presets)
- Added X button to clear the custom name quickly
- Added "Selected: [name]" text below the input to show current selection
- Better visual distinction between preset buttons and custom input

### 2. Movie Details Modal (`src/components/movie/MovieDetailsModal.tsx`)
**Problem:** "Watched With" field was completely missing from the edit modal.

**Solution:**
- Added "Watched With" field to the Personal tab
- Shows current buddy name (or "Solo" if empty)
- In edit mode: input field with green checkmark confirmation and Clear button
- Added to state management and type definitions

## How It Works

**"Watched With" vs "Tags":**
- **Watched With:** Single-value field storing one person's name
- **Tags:** Multi-value system for categorizing movies

**User Flow:**
1. Click a preset button OR type a custom name
2. See visual confirmation of selection
3. Value is saved when clicking "Add to Collection" or "Save"

## Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/add/page.tsx` - Enhanced UX with indicators
- `src/components/movie/MovieDetailsModal.tsx` - Added missing field
- Type definitions updated for `buddy_watched_with`

**Build Status:** ✅ All checks passing
