# Session Notes

This folder contains chronological session notes documenting work completed in each Claude Code session.

## Purpose

Session notes provide:
- **Quick Context**: Help new agents understand recent changes
- **Historical Record**: Track development progress over time
- **Decision Log**: Document important architectural decisions
- **Continuity**: Enable seamless handoff between sessions

## Structure

**File Naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-01-20.md`)

**Template:** See `TEMPLATE.md` for the standard format

## Usage

### For Claude Code Agents

**Always start by reading the most recent session file.** This is referenced in `docs/session-start/QUICK-START.md` and provides essential context about:
- What was worked on most recently
- Current state of development
- Any ongoing tasks or blockers
- Important decisions made

### Creating a New Session Note

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md`
2. Name it with today's date: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Fill in sections concisely:
   - **Context**: Why this work was needed
   - **Work Completed**: Key tasks accomplished
   - **Key Files Changed**: Most important files modified
   - **Issues Resolved**: Problems fixed
   - **Next Steps**: Ongoing tasks (if any)
   - **Notes**: Important context for future sessions

### Guidelines

- **Be concise**: Bullet points over paragraphs
- **Focus on essentials**: What would the next agent need to know?
- **Avoid bloat**: Skip obvious details, focus on decisions and gotchas
- **Update QUICK-START.md**: Always update the "Latest Session" link

## Retention

Keep all session notes for historical reference. They're small text files and provide valuable project history.
